# Axxes Traineeship 2024 - React

### Exercise 3 (Unidirectional data flow)

1. Create an `Input` component which should be a combination of a `<label>` and an `<input>`

2. Create a `UserForm` component with 3 fields: first name, last name and email (each field is an `Input` component)

3. The `UserForm` should have default values for the fields and an `onSubmit` event as props

4. Add the `UserForm` to the `App`

5. Use the `Table` component to display users

6. When the `onSubmit` event triggers the new user should become visible in the table
